The ASOT helps direct the antimicrobial treatment and is used to assist in the diagnosis of scarlet fever, rheumatic fever and post infectious glomerulonephritis.

A positive test usually is >200 units/mL,[1] but normal ranges vary from laboratory to laboratory and by age.[2]

The false negatives rate is 20-30%.[1] If a false negative is suspected, then an anti-DNase B titre should be sought. False positives can result from liver disease and tuberculosis.[1]

Valvular heart problems can be corrected surgically, by direct repair of the valve, replacement of the damaged valve with an artificial valve, or by a nonsurgical technique called balloon valvuloplasty.
